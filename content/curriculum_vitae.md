## Education
**PhD Genome Sciences 2014**  
University of Washington (Seattle, WA)  
*Dissertation: Population genomic insights into recent human evolution*  

**BA Biology 2008**  
Alfred University, Alfred, NY  
*summa cum laude*, Biology honors, minor in anthropology  
National Merit Scholarship  


## Experience

#### Genetic Analysis Center
**University of Washington Biostatistics (Seattle, WA)**  
*Supervisor [May 2018 - present]*  
*Research scientist [Oct 2014 - present]*  

* Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)
    * Phenotype harmonization across dozens of studies
    * Development of Phenotype Inventory Explorer web app with Django
    * Consulting and advising on NIH and NHLBI cloud analysis platforms
* Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)
    * GWAS of lipids, ankle-brachial index, dental caries, missing teeth, smoking behavior, and other health outcomes

#### Josh Akey's lab
**University of Washington Genome Sciences (Seattle, WA)**  
*Postdoctoral fellow [Mar 2014 - Jul 2014]*  
*Graduate research assistant [Sep 2008 - Mar 2014]*  

* Simulated human genetic data to characterize the strengths and weaknesses of multiple statistics to detect recent natural selection on human genes.
* Demonstrated that mitochondrial DNA (commonly used in ancestry testing) is not a good predictor of overall genetic ancestry
* Investigated two statistics for using genetic data to estimate past human sex ratios (number of males to females) and showed that they capture information from different periods of time.
