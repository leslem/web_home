I combined my interests in evolutionary biology and computers by pursuing independent bioinformatics
projects as an undergrad. I went on to earn my PhD in the University of Washington's Genome Sciences
program, where I investigated the ways that natural selection and population size changes have
affected human genetic diversity.

For the past 5 years I've been working on large collaborative genetic research projects at UW's
Biostatistics department. I have a passion for Python, R, data analysis, and visualization.

Automate everything. Question everything. Get things done.
