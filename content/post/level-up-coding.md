For those of us coding for research applications, it can be difficult to judge how much time, effort, and learning to put into programming skills. When your goal is to answer research questions (and publish papers about them), good programming practice can feel like a distraction. 

When I started my PhD program ten years ago, I was learning programming nearly from scratch. I had decent Unix skills, but the only coding I'd done was on a TI-83. I quickly learned R and Python and was very excited to use these new tools in my research on human population genetics. 

But once I'd learned the basics, I spent a couple of years at a plateau. I was writing single-use data analysis scripts and it was working for me, but every time I copy/pasted code from one script to another I couldn't help but think that there must be a better way. Well, there was a better way, and I've put together a list of the skills that I needed to take my scientific computing to the next level. These are the coding practices and skills that I have found to be the most useful.

## Why are these skills important?
- Accuracy
- Reproducibility
- Time saving
- Prevent bugs


- Run batch scripts, rather than working interactively
- Write reusable functions
- Add tests
    - Add ad hoc tests
    - Add unit tests
    - Add integration tests
- Start using version control
- Use a package manager and control the package version you use
- Run your scripts on a cluster or in the cloud, instead of on your laptop/desktop
- Use logging
- Use savepoints or checkpointing
- Write report files that summarize your analysis (but are not the entirety of your analysis)
- Learn about object-oriented programming and look for opportunities to use it
- Learn about databases and how to use them for your work
- Learn UNIX skills
    - grep
    - awk/sed
    - piping, input, output
    - jobs, bg, fg
    - processes
    - different kinds of shells
    - aliases
    - profiles
