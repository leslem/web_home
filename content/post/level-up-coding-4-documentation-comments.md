## Parts of good documentation

#### Sensible variable/function/class names
- If you give your objects names with obvious meaning, you'll need less documentation to explain what's going on
- Don't be afraid of long object names
- Follow your language's conventions for naming different objects (snake_case or camelCase)

#### Unstructured inline documentation
- Comments

#### Structured inline documentation
- docstrings in Python
- roxygen comments in R

#### Narrative documentation
- What is the goal of the project?
- Why you made larger design choices
- How to run everything from start to finish
- Installation/setup instructions

## Arguments for documenting your code well

#### As a way to plan out your code (pseudocode, code skeleton)

#### For your future self

#### For sharing your code with others

#### So you're not getting code support emails from your PhD lab 5 years later


## Useful kinds of code comments

#### Brief explanation for a tricky or dense section of code

#### Link to a reference for particular approach (e.g. SO post)

#### Explanation of a coding choice

#### Information about a data source, API, or other external resource

#### Author information
