Why use a package manager
- Keep track of packages needed
- Makes it easier for others to use your code
- Makes it easier for you to run your code in a new environment/system
- Keep track of specific versions used (reproducibility)


Package managers you can use
- Python
    - pipenv/virtualenv
    - conda
- R
    - packrat
    - renv
- Language-agnostic
    - Docker (sort of)


An example from my own projects
- requirements.txt in a Python project
- virtualenv
- piptools for better versioning
