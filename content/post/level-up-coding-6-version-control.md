Intro:
All have had experience of making a bunch of changes we want to roll back

Version control to use
- SVN
- Mercurial
- Git

Central repository locations for Git
- GitHub.com
- GitLab
- BitBucket
- Shared server (not recommended - use private repos on GitHub instead)

Reasons to use Git(Hub)
- Prevent the version in filenames antipattern
- Able to revert code to previous versions
- Able to try out different variants of code (branches)
- Able to start new projects from old ones as a starting point (forking) and integrate any changes you make into both
- Easier to collaborate on projects with others (merging and pull requests)
- Access your code from anywhere
- Backup your code
- Make your code publicly accessible (R packages, paper methods, etc.)

Ways to use Git
- Command line
- Integrated into your coding environment (RStudio)
- A GUI: SourceTree, GitKraken, others
