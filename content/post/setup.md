I love to hear about others' tools and office setups, so I'm sharing mine as well. See the fabulous
[uses this](https://usesthis.com) for setup interviews with all sorts of interesting people.

## The space
At home, I've got three main places where I get work done. In my office, I've got the walls painted my favorite shade of
teal. I have a custom-made desk that I built a few years
ago when I couldn't find anything that I really liked. The desktop has a couple of drawers sitting on it, and a
three-tiered inbox for keeping all of my loose papers in check before processing. My desk chair from Ikea is somewhat
minimal and promotes good posture. There are lots of drawers and boxes in a pair of Ikea Expedit shelves for organizing
all of my electronics, papers, notebooks, pens, and craft supplies.

In the living room, I often want to do a quick bit of work from my laptop without getting all settled into my office.
A few years ago I upgraded from my old Ikea armchair to an Ekornes Wing chair, size medium. It's one of the best
purchases I've ever made. I still have a somewhat rickety Ikea laptop table that I use for longer periods of time
working from my laptop.

In the dining area, I have my laptop's usual docking station set up on top of a cabinet, in a makeshift standing desk.
I'll work from this area for ~ 15 minutes or so when I just need to do some quick tasks on my laptop without even
getting settled in to a chair. Here I use a laptop stand that was custom-made for me by a friend.

At work, I've been around long enough to have worked my way up to a window cubicle with an astounding view west towards
the Olympic mountain range. When our cubicles were rearranged a couple of years ago I had my desk adjusted to my
preferred writing and keyboard height, and my desktop placed on a shelf a few inches higher. I've got a very minimal
chair that meets my main criterion of not having armrests.

## The hardware

My main computer is an iMac (27-inch Retina 5K from 2017). I ordered it with a 1TB SSD with the plan that I would keep
all of my main data sources there (photographs, music library, ebooks, etc.) but I'm already running out of space almost
two years later. I added two 8 GB RAM sticks shortly after purchase, bringing the total to 24 GB. My last Mac desktop
(a PowerMac G5) lasted me for ten years, and I plan to make this one last just as long. I use the Apple wireless
keyboard with numpad and a Magic Mouse 2. I use a Fujitsu ScanSnap S1300i scanner to digitize all of my documents as
they come in. I'm also slowly but surely digitizing two boxes of old papers.

My laptop is a MacBook Pro (13-inch 2015 Retina, the last model without the touchbar). It's got 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB
SSD and it still feels super fast to me. I have another Magic Mouse 2 to go with my laptop and I try to use it as much
as possible because the trackpad is terrible for my hands. I've got a silicon cover for the keyboard to keep it
relatively clean. The Timbuktu laptop sleeve I bought for my previous laptop (a 13-inch 2011 MacBook Pro) still fits
this thinner laptop, so I use the same one.

My phone is an iPhone 8 with 256 GB of storage. I didn't even get a smartphone until 2014, but now this phone is pretty
much always with me. I also have an iPad Pro (2nd-gen 10.5-inch, 2017), which I try to take with me anywhere I don't 
need my laptop. I bought this model specifically for the use of the Apple Pencil, which I use for handwriting everyday.
At work, I take my iPad with me to
all meetings in lieu of a notepad. I'll type notes if possible, but if not then I write them digitally with the Pencil.
The Pencil has felt like the last necessary element for keeping all of my notes and documents digitally rather than
letting the paper stack up. I use a Logitech K380 bluetooth keyboard to type on the iPad when I know I'll have a surface
available for it. It also has physical keys for switching between three different devices, so I use it with my iPhone
and my laptop as well.

For reading, I use a Kobo Clara HD eReader. I've previously had a Kindle and then a Kindle Paperwhite, and the Clara's
interface is comparable, if not better. 

My favorite recent hardware purchase is a pair of BeatsX bluetooth headphones, so now I can listen to podcasts, music,
and audiobooks even more than I already did. I spend at least a couple of hours per day listening to these headphones.

I track some basic health metrics (step count and heart rate) with a Garmin Forerunner 235. I also use it for tracking
running and hiking activities. I really like that the onboard GPS means it doesn't have to be paired to your phone to
track an activity. It's getting a bit old now, but still holds a charge for days at a time.

Finally, I run a server that I built a few years ago to serve as a data repository and provide remote access. It has a
3 GHz Intel Pentium CPU, 8 GB RAM, and four HDDs - a 500 GB RAID0 array with the OS installed and a 2 TB RAID0 array
storing most of my data. I've got dynamic DNS set up to be able to log in from outside my local network.
