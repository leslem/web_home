I'm a computational biologist, programmer, and research scientist at the University of Washington.

I combined my interests in evolutionary biology and computers by pursuing independent bioinformatics
projects as an undergrad. I went on to earn my PhD in the University of Washington's Genome Sciences
program, where I investigated the ways that natural selection and population size changes have
affected human genetic diversity.

For the past 5 years I've been working on large collaborative genetic research projects at UW's
Biostatistics department. My group develops pipelines and workflows for analysis and QC of
large, heterogeneous genotype and phenotype datasets.

I have a passion for Python, R, data analysis, visualization, reproducibile research, well-commmented
code, keyboard shortcuts, and productivity tools.
